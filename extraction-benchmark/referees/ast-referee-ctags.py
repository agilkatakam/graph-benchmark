"""Second, independent ground truth for C and C++ — from Universal Ctags.

Why this exists. Both systems under test parse C/C++ with tree-sitter, so a tree-sitter referee
grades two systems that share a grammar. A shared parser hides every defect that lives where the
parser itself gives up, and on C/C++ tree-sitter gives up on a large fraction of the corpus —
it reports a parse error over roughly a quarter to a half of the bytes of these repositories.

Universal Ctags is a mature, hand-written declaration indexer with no tree-sitter lineage, and
it is built for exactly the question this benchmark asks: what does this file declare? It does
not need include paths, a compilation database, or a build — which is what rules out a
compiler-grade referee here. clang parses ONE preprocessor configuration and needs the project
configured; ctags reads every branch, as tree-sitter does, so the two referees are answering
the same question rather than two different ones.

Implements the taxonomy fixed in ast-referee.py's `── C / C++ ──` header, in ctags' kinds:

    types      struct · union · enum · class · typedef · alias
    methods    function · prototype · function-like macro
    fields     member · enumerator
    constants  object-like macro

Excluded here as there: file-scope variables (`variable`, `externvar`), labels, locals,
parameters, and `header` (an include, not a declaration).

── Go ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`--lang go` makes this the SECOND referee for Go; the primary is `ast-referee-goast/`, built on
go/parser. Both are needed because both systems under test parse Go with tree-sitter, so a
tree-sitter referee would grade two systems sharing a grammar.

Same taxonomy as the go/ast referee, in ctags' kinds:

    types      struct · interface · type (a defined type over any underlying type) · talias
    methods    func · methodSpec
    fields     member · anonMember (an embedded field; its name IS the unqualified type name)
    constants  const · var (package level — ctags does not tag declarations inside a body)

Excluded there and here: `package`, `packageName` (the package clause and an import's local
name — not declarations of program entities), `receiver` (off by default, and a parameter),
`unknown`, and the blank identifier `_`, which has no stable name to match on.

── PHP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`--lang php` makes this the SECOND referee for PHP; the primary is `ast-referee-phpast.php`,
built on the PHP compiler's own AST (`ext/ast`). Same taxonomy, in ctags' kinds:

    types      class · interface · trait          (ctags has NO enum kind for PHP — see below)
    methods    function                           (method vs function separated by scopeKind)
    fields     variable (a property, when its scope is a class/trait/interface) ·
               define at class scope (a class constant)
    constants  define at namespace/file scope

Excluded there and here: `alias` (a `use` import), `namespace`, `local`, ctags' generated
`AnonymousClassNNNN` name, and a `variable` at file scope — a top-level `$x = 1` is a statement
executed in global scope, not a declaration.

**Two known blind spots, both confirmed on a probe file before measuring.** ctags has no PHP
`enum` kind at all: a PHP 8.1 `enum Level: int { case Debug; }` yields no type, no cases, and
files its methods under the enclosing namespace. And it does not model promoted constructor
properties (`__construct(private Logger $log)`). Both are real declarations and both are emitted
by the primary referee.

── Kotlin ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`--lang kotlin` makes this the SECOND referee for Kotlin; the primary is
`ast-referee-ktpsi/`, built on the Kotlin compiler's own PSI. Same taxonomy, in ctags' kinds:

    types      class · interface · object · typealias
    methods    method
    fields     constant · variable, when the scope is a class/interface/object
    constants  constant · variable, when the scope is a package (file level)

Excluded there and here: `package`, and anything whose scope is a `method` — ctags DOES report
declarations inside a function body for Kotlin (unlike its Go and PHP parsers), and a local
`val` is not a declaration of a program entity.

**One known blind spot, confirmed on a probe file before measuring.** ctags has no enum-entry
kind for Kotlin: `enum class Level { DEBUG, INFO }` yields the type but neither constant. Both
are real declarations and both are emitted by the primary referee.
